    "## Capital Asset Pricing Model\n",
    "The motivation behind Sharpe's (1964) CAPM model is closely related to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) introduced by Fama (1965). More specifically, Markowitz (1952) established the concept of the efficient frontier, which states that the only way to increase returns is by taking on more risk. Sharpe built on this idea by explaining excess returns (over the risk-free rate) in relation to the underlying risk. If risk fully explains excess returns, it supports the conclusion that markets are efficient, and the only way to achieve higher returns is by moving along the efficient frontier through increased risk-taking. \n",

    "For this to be true, the following are insufficient, but necessary: \n",
    "- The model explain well the excess return (High $R^2$);\n",

    "## The Fama-French Factor Model\n",
    "The issue with CAPM lies in its simplicity and reliance on a single factor — market risk $(R_m - R_f)$ — to explain asset returns. If one accepts the efficient frontier, it raises the question: why would an investor achieve higher returns for the same level of risk? Yet, numerous papers have shown evidence of such anomalies (CITE PAPERS). This has led some to argue that CAPM's failure to fully explain market returns suggests that markets may not be efficient. However, this interpretation is flawed due to the joint hypothesis problem. Testing market efficiency using CAPM conflates three possibilities: (1) the model is correct, and the market is inefficient, (2) the model is incorrect, but the market is efficient, or (3) both the model and the market hypothesis are wrong. This ambiguity complicates conclusions about market efficiency and highlights the challenges of using a model to test the Efficient Market Hypothesis. While this may seem unscientific — given science is often defined by falsifiability — it remains a core issue in financial theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In response, researchers identified additional factors, driven by anomalies that CAPM could not explain. Two key anomalies persisted: the size effect—where smaller firms tend to outperform larger ones for a given level of risk—and the value effect, where high book-to-market firms outperform low book-to-market firms. These persistent deviations from CAPM predictions led Fama and French to develop multi-factor models, starting with the 3-Factor Model, which incorporates size (SMB) and value (HML) factors. They later expanded it to the 5-Factor Model, adding profitability (RMW) and investment (CMA) to better capture variations in return Both models led to higher explanatory power and were robust at the time of their publication (see discussion at the end). .\n",

    "### Comparison of CAMP, Factor 3 and Factor 5 in Manufacturing\n",
    "#### CAMP Vs. Factor 3\n",
    "Once we include the factors from the Fama-French 3-Models (and robust to 5-Factor Models), it is notable that the market excess decreases significantly (~20%). This indicates that less of the excess is attributed to market risk. The reduction could be due to the CAPM's omission of additional risk factors, which led to an upward bias in the market excess under the CAMP. Specifically, the Size (SMB) and, to a lesser extent, Value (HML) factors provide alternative explanations for excess returns. In fact, we see the market excess approaching 1, which is exactly what we would expect, as manufacturing is a diverse industry with players of various sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, despite these factors being positively correlated with market risk (as evidenced by the reduced market excess coefficient), they capture a distinct set of idiosyncratic risks associated with small-cap and value stocks that are not fully explained by market trends, thus, explaining the additional return relative to market movement. This diversification is particularly valuable for portfolio management, as it enhances the risk-return tradeoff by adding imperfectly correlated sources of return to the portfolio, thus reducing portfolio's drawdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factor 3 Vs. Factor 5\n",
    "First, it is worth emphasizing that the factor-3 model is particularly robust compared to the factor-5 model, with the factor-3 coefficients remaining largely unchanged (except for a slight decrease in the Size factor, SMB). It is clear that small-cap stocks significantly contribute to manufacturing returns. However, the negative coefficient for Profitability (RMW) is noteworthy, as it suggests that less profitable manufacturing firms tend to contribute more to the sector's returns. Although this may seem odd, it aligns with the Kenneth French Data Library but contrasts with a joint CFA Institute report, which highlights RMW as \"the single factor that has consistently delivered excess returns over time\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the Factor-5 model highlights that conservative investment strategies tend to yield higher returns.\n",

    "A key concern is that the Factor-3 model, which was a seminal paper in the 1990s, may no longer hold true in today's market. To address this, we briefly test it with data split into pre- and post-2000 periods. We find that the results are surprisingly robust. That being said, we do see a weakness in the impact of the Small and Value stock, but that could also be that these factors have been partly priced in the pre-2000, reducing the premium. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could indeed try a shorter time horizon, but, shorter periods (e.g., less than 20 years) can obscure the true long-term return trends. For example, the U.S. stock market rallied exceptionally well in the 1990s, but investors who went all-in then experienced the \"lost decade\" of poor returns during the 2000s. Worse, if they exited during this period, they would have missed the fantastic bull market that began in the early 2010s. \n",
    "\n",
    "One alternative is to follow Buffett's advice of investing 100% in the S&P 500. However, this may not be optimal, as there are uncorrelated risks available that can improve diversification. Additionally, while current market valuations reflect strong fundamentals, the implicit pricing assumption of two-digit growth in future profits is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. The key difference this time is that today's companies tend to have far stronger fundamentals than those during the dot-com era.\n",
